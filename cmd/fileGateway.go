Instead, KinK provides an optional component called the file gateway, which allows you to send a tar archive
to a NodePort or ingress and have it be extracted into a directory shared with the rest of your cluster.
This avoids having to funnel your archive through the control plane via port-forward or kubectl cp, which
may be bandwidth-constrained`,
